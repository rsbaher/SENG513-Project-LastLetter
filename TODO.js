//=======================================================================================================
// NICE TO HAVE / FUTURE FEATURES:




// TODO better styling

// TODO make sure that one person has not been chosen by multiple players

// TODO may need to change later that can get a user obj if close the window and open again (Index.js emailToGame)

// TODO what if user opens window in two tabs???
// TODO authorized user is on home page, he opens another link in his browser,
// TODO then comes back, he sees a login page, but should see a page from which he left a game

// TODO deploy final version before deadline


//========================================================================================
// TODO FINISHED:
// TODO pop the game, when the user exits, disconnects
// TODO save, load game
// TODO When delete a single player game, make sure to check that highest score is updated in the database if necessary
// TODO don't show login page if a user did not log out --> Done but slow (login page displays for a bit before home page loads) --> cookies might be faster (probably)
// TODO Implement multiplayer
// TODO Enabling of buttons should be on load home
// TODO remove user from wait list in multiplayer if he exits
// TODO dictionary email to userObj
